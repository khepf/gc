// WISH

- need to solve reads issue (expensive) local cache read/write and read/write to db once a day?
- - learn firestore https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofux_4c94FI&list=PLl-K7zZEsYLluG5MCVEzXAQ7ACZBCuZgZ&index=2
- netlify serverless functions
- need roles with test users capped at 50 entries
- ebay api - registered, check back in a day
- image upload - reddit post
- sort by year, then brand, then card number - almost there . issue is cardNumber is string not number, I think

// BLOCKED

- create-reusable-ads-banners-with-angular-and-google-adsense - not enough site views, too new of a site
